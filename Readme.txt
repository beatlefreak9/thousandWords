THOUSANDWORDS - (c)2012 Mitchell Rysavy

---------------------
WHAT IT DOES
---------------------

Have you ever heard the phrase "A picture is worth a thousand words?" ThousandWords will take a picture of your choice and a few words to describe that picture, and from those words it will crawl a thesaurus to generate a list of 1,000 words and then create a picture from the words it has found.

---------------------
WHAT IT NEEDS
---------------------

Because there are no published binaries, you will need to need to compile/run ThousandWords yourself. It was created in Visual Studio 2010 with .NET 4.0.
In addition to the environment, you will need a copy of the NHunspell .NET  libraries (http://nhunspell.sourceforge.net/) and the thesaurus component of the Hunspell project, MyThes (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hunspell/files/MyThes/1.2.3/mythes-1.2.3.tar.gz/download).
It is unknown if this will work for thesauruses of other languages, but I suspect that it will.

---------------------
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
---------------------

Currently, genereted pictures are very low resolution and oddly-colored. The generation process itself is in bad need of optimization.
